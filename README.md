# Auto Scrapper

Tired of scrapping the same item on every single scrapper? Now you can set limits for each item and see the magic automagically remove the items you don't want.

## Roadmap

General:
- [ ] Add dependencies

Config:
- [ ] Dynamic config with all items with settable limits

Scrapping:
- [ ] Skip items where the limit is 0
- [ ] All items over the limit scrapped on scrapper interact

Check:
- [ ] Multiplayer Compatibility
  - [ ] Scraps according to local player's config
  - [ ] Scraps only local player's items

Bonus features:
- [ ] Make config overrideable per character
- [ ] Integrate with Risk of Options
