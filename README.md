# Auto Scrapper

Tired of scrapping the same item on every single scrapper? Now you can set limits for each item and see the magic automagically remove the items you don't want.

## Roadmap

General:
- [x] Add dependencies

Config:
- [x] Dynamic config with all items with settable limits
- [x] Default value overrides - for example for goggles
- [x] User can determine whether to keep scrapper closed after automatic scrapping

Scrapping:
- [x] Skip items where the limit is 0
- [x] All items over the limit scrapped on scrapper interact
- [x] UI shows only the remaining items

  - [ ] Scraps only local player's items
